**Abstract**\
Image recognition is an exciting new field and has many important applications ranging from delivery service, payment processing, and public safety. We wanted to take image recognition and apply it to cars. Have you ever wondered what the car model is when you received an Amber Alert? What kind of car is the suspect driving? We believe by applying cameras with high speed image recognition capability at key highway intersections, we are able to match the car to the model and help police find the criminal faster. We used the Stanford Car Dataset and a variety of transfer learning models. We found RestNet50 to be our best model.\
